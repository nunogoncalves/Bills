and keep an ideia of what's going on.

-Work in progress.

Ideas:

 - Possibity to comunicate with proper APIS to post new ads when landlord is looking for new tenants
 - Manage tenants (names, dates of entry and exit)
 - Invite tenants so that he can check his account
 - Add new bills (and allow image upload for the bill receipt)
 - Calculate amout to pay to each tenant for each bill and ability to sum that all up
 - Email tenants with amount to pay (detailed information as well)
 - Given a bill, calculare price for tenants
 - View bill history, for each of the bills, or as a whole

- Tenant
 - Manage Bills
